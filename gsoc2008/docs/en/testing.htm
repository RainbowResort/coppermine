<p>Dear Tester,</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to test Coppermine Photo Gallery. Please be rough on the program so that we can track down and eliminate bugs from our public release of version 1.5.</p>
<p>Please understand that this is still beta software that is meant to be used for testing purposes and not for production, so there is no support for cpg1.5.x yet.</p>

<p>While testing CPG 1.5.x, please make certain to note any odd behavior you encounter.  This could include typographical errors, misleading instructions, or any other out-right error.  If you encounter a major error, please switch the debug mode to &quot;on&quot; in the configuration panel and copy the text in the debug window.  This will greatly aid the development team in hunting down the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Areas to be particularly mindful of:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Please test every facet of CPG, from the installation on to every feature available (and in as many themes and languages as possible).</li>
<li>If you have the ability to test GD1, GD2 and ImageMagick, please test all of them.</li>
<li>Please attempt to use multiple types of graphics such as JPEG, PNG and GIF (for ImageMagick and GD 2.0.28+ users).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please report your test results to the <a href="http://coppermine-gallery.net/forum/index.php?board=85.0">testing board</a>, but before starting a new thread make sure that the potential bug you're going to report hasn't been posted before.</p>

<p><strong>The report format should include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Server OS</li>
<li>Web Server Software</li>
<li>GD, GD2 or ImageMagick Test</li>
<li>PHP Version</li>
<li>BB Integration (if any)</li>
<li>Themes fully tested (by fully tested, we mean as many different features as possible using that theme)</li>
<li>Major Errors</li>
<li>Client OS and Browser</li>
<li>Fresh install or upgrade (if upgrade, from which version of cpg)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your test results will not merely be used to fix problems but will also be used to tout the compatibility of CPG with multiple browsers and OS's.  That is why this information is important EVEN IF YOU FIND NOTHING WRONG.</p>

<p>Thanks for your participation and your time in making CPG the premiere open-source photo gallery!</p>

<p class="important">Warning: cpg1.5.x hasn't been released yet - only a <a href="dev_subversion.htm#dev_subversion_checking_out">svn checkout</a> is currently possible (cpg1.5.x folder). When testing alpha software, make sure that your checkout is up-to-date.</p>
