<p>In previous versions of Coppermine the "Powered by Coppermine" used to be obfuscated to make it hard for non-coders to remove the tag. The reason behind this was an additional license add-on that disallowed users to change the line. The dev team has reviewed this policy for cpg1.5.x and decided that end users <strong>are</strong> allowed to change or remove the line in legal terms.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>: We have a forum policy for the support board instead: support will only be given for galleries that show the "Powered by Coppermine" tag unobfuscated.</p>
<p>Before removing the credits, please consider this as well: Coppermine is free software, the dev team <strong>asks</strong> you to keep the footer intact. We're convinced that you should give credit where credit is due. So please think twice before you decide to remove the tag.</p>
<p>This being said, this is how you can change the tag: to edit the place where the tag is being displayed, edit <tt class="code">themes/yourtheme/template.html</tt> and move the placeholder <tt class="code">{CREDITS}</tt> around. As it is being generated by Coppermine's pagefooter function, it needs to appear below the <tt class="code">{GALLERY}</tt>-token. To change the content of the disclaimer, edit <tt class="code">themes/yourtheme/theme.php</tt> and edit the function <tt class="code">theme_credits</tt> as you see fit. If this function doesn't exist in your custom theme, copy it from the sample theme into your custom theme first.</p>
