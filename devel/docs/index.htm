      <H1>Categories, albums and pictures<A id=cat_alb_pic 
      name=cat_alb_pic></A></H1>
      <P>The Coppermine Photo Gallery (CPG) works in the following way:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Pictures are stored in albums</LI>
        <LI>Albums are organised in categories</LI>
        <LI>Categories can be nested (subcategories)</LI>
			</UL>
      <P>If you don't have many albums, you don't need to use categories. In 
      that case you don't create any category and all your albums will appear on 
      the main page of the script.</P>
      <P>There is a special category named "<B>User galleries</B>". This 
      category can't be deleted. If a user belongs to a group where "can have a 
      personal gallery" is set to YES, he will have the right to create his own 
      albums and his gallery will be a sub-category of "User galleries".</P>
      <P>The administrator can create albums in any category. Regular users can 
      only create albums in "User galleries/Their_username".</P>
      <P><a class="back" href="#top">Back to 
      top</a></P>
      <HR>

      <H1>Admin mode &amp; User mode<A id=admin_user_mode 
      name=admin_user_mode></A></H1>
      <P>When you are logged in as an admin, the script has two modes of 
      operation : Admin mode &amp; User mode. You switch between Admin &amp; 
      User mode by clicking on the corresponding link in the menu bar at the top 
      of the screen.</P>
      <P>When you are in admin mode, you can administer your gallery and the 
      following menu bar appears :</P>
      <P><IMG src="pics/admin_mode_bar.GIF" border="1" /></P>
      <P>When you are in user mode you are just a regular user and can't access 
      the admin pages.</P>
      <P><a class="back" href="#top">Back to 
      top</a></P>
      <HR>

      <H1>The group control panel<A id=group_cp name=group_cp></A></H1>
      <P><IMG src="pics/group_cp.GIF" border="1" /></P>
      <P>This is where you define what members of a group can and can't do.</P>
      <P>The disk quota applies only for groups where "Can have a personal" 
      gallery has been set to "YES". Only pictures uploaded by a user in his 
      personal gallery are included in the quota.</P>
      <P>Use the <B>anonymous</B> group to define what non-registered users can 
      and can't do. Quota and "Can have a personal gallery" are meaningless for 
      anonymous users.</P>
      <P>Bear in mind that if a user is a member of a group where "can rate 
      pictures", "can post comments" or "can upload pictures" is set YES, he 
      will have the right to perform these operations only in albums where they 
      are allowed, ie. uploading pictures will only be possible in albums where 
      "Visitors can upload pictures" has been set to YES.</P>
      <P>If "can have a personal gallery" is set to YES, the members of the 
      group will have their own gallery in the "User galleries" category where 
      they will be able to create their own albums.</P>
      <P>If "priv. upl. approval" is set to NO, pictures uploaded by members of 
      the group in albums created in their own gallery won't need to be approved 
      by the admin.</P>

      <UL>
        <LI>The <IMG height=16 src="pics/edit.gif" width=16> button 
        allows you to edit the title, description and parent category of an 
        existing cetegory. 
        <LI>The <IMG height=16 src="pics/delete.gif" width=16> button 
        allows you to delete a category. Deleting a category does not delete the 
        albums and pictures it contains. They are simply moved to the "Root" 
        category. 
        <LI>The <IMG height=16 src="pics/up.gif" width=16> and <IMG 
        height=16 src="pics/down.gif" width=16> buttons allow you to 
        order your categories. 
        <LI>The "<B>Move into</B>" dropdown lists allow you to change the parent 
        of a specific category. </LI></UL>
      <P>"<B>User galleries</B>" is a special category. It is not visible unless 
      you have some users that have created their own gallery. It can't be 
      deleted but you can edit its title and description by using the <IMG 
      height=16 src="edit.gif" width=16> button. </P>

      <P><IMG src="pics/album_menu.GIF" border="1" /></P>
      <P><B>Delete</B> allows you to delete the album and all pictures it

      <P>CPG allows you to batch add pictures via FTP.  You can upload entire groups
			of pictures to be added all at once through this function.  Photos should be 
			uploaded under the albums directory; but, <b>they should not be uploaded anywhere
			under the userpics directory!</b>  </P>
			<p>Once you have uploaded your photos, click on the Batch Add Pictures button
			and find the directory under which you have uploaded your photos.  Select this
			directory and then select the photos you wish to upload and the album you 
			wish to insert them into.  Click "Insert Selected	Pictures."  CPG will 
			then display the results of the batch add.</p>

			<P>Toggles the display of the private album icon to unlogged users.</P>
      <H3>Characters forbidden in filenames</H3>
      <P>When the filename of a picture that is uploaded contains one of these 
      characters, it will be replaced with an underscore.</P>
      <P>Don't change this unless you know exactly what you are doing.</P>
      <H3>Accepted file extensions for uploaded pictures</H3>
      <P>Any file uploaded whose extension is not in this list will be rejected 
      by the script. This is intended to prevent a user from uploading non-image 
      files.</P>
      <P>The script can only handle image files, so you won't add support for 
      instance for video files by adding AVI to the list.</P>
      <P>The GD library only supports JPEG and PNG images so other types of 
      files will be rejected even if their extension is valid.</P>
      <H3>Method for resizing images</H3>
      <P>If you are using GD 1.x and the colors of your thumbnails or 
      intermediate image are wrong then switch to GD 2.x</P>
      <H3>Path to ImageMagick 'convert' utility (example /usr/bin/X11/)</H3>
      <P>If you are using ImageMagick convert utility to resize you picture, you 
      must enter the name of the directory where the convert program is located 
      there. Don't forget the trailing "/".</P>
      <P>If your server is running under Windows, use / and not \ to separate 
      components of the path (eg. use C:/ImageMagick/ and not C:\ImageMagick\). 
      This path must not contain any space so under Windows don't put 
      ImageMagick in the "Program files" directory.</P>
      <P><B>ImageMagick will hardly work if PHP on your server is running in 
      SAFE mode and it is a real challenge to get it running under Windows. 
      Consider using GD in these cases and don't waste your time asking for 
      support in the forum. There are too many things that can prevent 
      ImageMagick to work correctly and without a physical access to your server 
      it is hard to guess what is wrong.</B></P>
      <H3>Allowed image types (only valid for ImageMagick)</H3>
      <P>This is the list of image types that the script will accept when using 
      ImageMagick. Image type detection is performed by reading the header of 
      the file and not by looking at its file extension.</P>
      <H3>Command line options for ImageMagick</H3>
      <P>Here you can add options that will be appended to the command line when 
      executing ImageMagick. Read the ImageMagick Convert manual to see what is 
      available.</P>
      <H3>Read EXIF data in JPEG files</H3>
      <P>With this option turned on, the script will read the EXIF data stored 
      by digicams in JPEG files. This option will work only if PHP was compiled 
      with the EXIF extension.</P>
      <H3>The album directory</H3>
      <P>This is the base directory for your "Image Store". The path is relative 
      to the main directory of the script. </P>
      <P>You can use ../ in the path to move-up one level in the directory 
      tree.</P>
      <P>You can not use an absolute path there ("/var/my_images/" will not 
      work) and the album directory must be visible by your web server.</P>
      <H3>The directory for user pictures</H3>
      <P>This is the directory where pictures uploaded with the web interface 
      are stored. This directory is a subdirectory of the album directory.</P>
      <P>The same remarks as above apply.</P>
      <P>When you upload pictures by FTP, store them in a subdirectory of the 
      "album directory" and not inside the "directory for user pictures". </P>
			<h3>The prefix for intermediate pictures</h3>
			<P>This prefix is added to the file name of created pictures.</P>
			<h3>The prefix for thumbnails</h3>
			<P>This prefix is added to the file name of created intermediate thumbnails.</P>
      <H3>Default mode for directories</H3>
      <P>If during the installation, the installer complained about directory 
      not having the right permissions set this to <B>0777</B> else you won't be 
      able to delete the directories created by the script with your FTP client 
      the day you will decide to uninstall the script.</P>
      <H3>Default mode for pictures</H3>
      <P>If during the installation, the installer complained about directories 
      not having the right permissions set this to <B>0666</B>.</P>
			<h3>Disable right-click on full-size pop-up</h3>
			<P>CPG will attempt to block contextual menus on full-size photo pages.</P>
			<h3>Disable right-click on all "regular" pages</h3>  
			<P>CPG will attempt to block contextual menus on all pages.</P>
      <H2>Cookies &amp; Charset settings</H2>
      <H3>Name of the cookie used by the script</H3>
      <P>Default value is "cpg11d". Even if you have multiple instances of the 
      script running on the same server you can keep the default value.</P>
      <H3>Path of the cookie used by the script</H3>
      <P>Default value is "/". Don't change this unless you know what you are 
      doing. This may prevent you from logging in.</P>
      <P>If you have broken your gallery by modifying this value, use phpMyAdmin 
      to edit the xxxx_config table in your database and restore the default 
      value. </P>
      <H3>Character encoding</H3>
      <P>This should normally be set to "Default (language file)" or "Unicode 
      (utf-8)". See the discussion in the "<B>language</B>" section of this 
      page.</P>
