<h1>Coppermine Photo Gallery Quick-Start Guide</h1>
<p>You’ve already downloaded the most recent version of Coppermine.  Now you’re 
probably wondering how to install it.  For that, you need to read the <a href="index.htm">documentation</a> that 
comes with Coppermine.  Take a look at where you extracted the zip file to.  There’s a 
folder called docs – all the documentation is in there.  If you are doing an upgrade from 
an older version of Coppermine, you need to read the docs for directions.</p>
<p>This is a stand alone version – if you are looking for something that integrates with PHP-
Nuke, you should visit <a href="http://www.nukephotogallery.com">http://www.nukephotogallery.com</a>
or <a href="http://www.cpgnuke.com">http://www.cpgnuke.com</a>.</p>
<p>Ok, so you don’t want to take the time to read the documentation.  Well, this guide will 
get you started with the basics.  Let’s jump into it, shall we?</p>
<p><b>Question:</b>  Does my webserver support Coppermine?<br />
<b>Answer:</b>  You need to have a webserver (Apache 2.0.50 recommended), PHP 4.1.0 or 
newer (4.3.8 recommended, 5.xx not recommended at this time), and MySQL 3.23.23 or 
newer (4.0.20 recommended).  You also need either GD 1.xx or 2.xx (2.xx 
recommended) or ImageMagick installed.  GD normally comes bundled with PHP; 
ImageMagick must be installed by your webhost.</p>
<p><b>Question:</b>  Where can I find out that stuff?<br />
<b>Answer:</b>  Ask your host, they’ll tell you.  You can also create a file called phpinfo.php 
and upload it to your site.  Type www.yoursite.com/phpinfo.php and see what versions 
you have.  Your host will tell you the location of ImageMagick, if it’s available.</p>
<p class="code">&#60;?php<br />
phpinfo();<br />
?&#62;</p>
<p><b>Question:</b>  Where do I put all these files?<br />
<b>Answer:</b>  You can put them in your root directory (not recommended) or upload the 
directory to your website.  We recommend uploading the directory cpg140 (and all the 
files contained within) to your webhost.</p>
<p><b>Question:</b>  Ok, I uploaded everything to www.yoursite.com/coppermine.  Now what?<br />
<b>Answer:</b>  You need to change permissions on a few directories before you can do 
anything else.  Using your FTP program or website Control Panel, change permissions on 
the include, albums, albums/userpics, and albums/edit directories to 777.  You should 
also create a new directory in albums that you will FTP your images/files to (call it 
uploads) and set it’s permissions to 777 also.</p>
<p><b>Question:</b>  I changed the permissions.  What’s next?<br />
<b>Answer:</b>  You need to create a MySQL database.  Using your website Control Panel or a 
tool like phpMyAdmin, create a MySQL database.  Write down the database name, the 
username and password – you’ll need it in a minute.  If you already have a database 
you’re using for a BBS or something else, that’s ok.  You can use that database for 
Coppermine, too.  If you have a BBS and plan on connecting it to Coppermine, you need 
to share the database anyway.</p>
<p><b>Question:</b>  My files are in place, permissions are set, and I have my MySQL database 
information.  What’s the next step?<br />
<b>Answer:</b>  Now you have to run the Coppermine install.  Just go to 
www.yousite.com/coppermine/install.php and fill in the information.</p>
<p><b>Question:</b>  There are error messages popping up?  What do I do?<br />
<b>Answer:</b>  First, read the documentation!  You should’ve done that already, you know.  
There’s a good chance you’ll find the answers you need.  If not, go to 
<a href="http://coppermine.sourceforge.net">http://coppermine.sourceforge.net</a> and check out the support boards.  Spend a while 
looking around and searching for your problem.  There’s probably a solution for your 
problem already posted.</p>
<p><b>Question:</b>  All right!  It’s installed and working!  Now what?<br />
<b>Answer:</b>  You need to look at the configuration of Coppermine to make sure it’s set up 
the way you want it.  Log in as the admin (if the Admin link isn’t visible, you already are 
logged in) and visit the Config section.  Here’s a few things you should look at:<br /><br />
<ul><li><u>General Settings:</u> You should put in your site name and email address, and set your time 
zone offset.</li>
<li><u>Language, Themes & Charset settings:</u>  Choose your language.</li>
<li><u>Files and thumbnails settings:</u>  Set the max size for uploaded files to whatever you’d 
like.  The default is 1024kb.  You should also take a look at the max width or height for 
uploaded pictures/videos – this will prevent your users from uploading images that are 
larger than you want.  If you want Coppermine to automatically resize images that are 
larger than what you’ve allowed, set auto resize images that are larger than max width or 
height to either Yes: Everyone or Yes: User only.  Everyone means everybody, including 
when the admin batch-adds pictures, and User means just your members when they 
upload pictures.</li>
<li><u>Files and thumbnails advanced settings:</u>  Make sure you have the correct image 
manipulation software selected.  If you are using GD, you should select GD2 if you have 
it available.  If you plan on using ImageMagick you should’ve already put in the path to 
the binaries (make sure it ends with a trailing slash).  Do you want your members to have 
private albums?  If you do, make sure to set "Users can have private albums" to Yes.</li>
<li><u>User settings:</u>  If you plan on letting people register and upload pictures, make sure you 
set "Allow new user registrations" to Yes.</li>
<li>You also need to take a peek at the groups settings.  Coppermine comes with four 
groups by default: administrators, registered users, anonymous users, and banned users.  
This is where you can give permission to send e-cards, upload files, etc.  This is also 
where you set the maximum allowed disk space for each group (disk quota).  It’s set to 
1024kb by default.</li></ul></p>
<p><b>Question:</b>  I think everything is set right.  Can I upload pictures yet?<br />
<b>Answer:</b>  No.  First you need to create an album to put them in.  In the same row as the 
Config link, you’ll see a link called Albums.  Click on it and you are taken to a screen 
that allows you to create an album.  Click "New Album", then rename it to whatever 
you’d like.  Click "Apply changes" and presto!  You now have an album.</p>
<p><b>Question:</b>  I made an album, so now can I upload pictures?<br />
<b>Answer:</b>  Yes.  As the admin, you should use your FTP program to upload your pictures 
to your website, then do a batch-add to put them into your Coppermine database.  Back at 
the beginning of this guide I told you to create a directory in albums for just this purpose.  
Let’s say you made one called "uploads".  FTP your images to albums/uploads.  When 
that’s done, click on batch-add.  Select uploads as the directory.  You are now presented 
with a list of all the pictures you just uploaded.  By default Coppermine selects all of the 
images.  Select the album to put them into, then click Go.  Viola, you now have pictures 
to look at!</p>
<p><b>Question:</b>  Can I add a title to a picture?<br />
<b>Answer:</b>  Yes you can.  On the main Coppermine screen, when you are logged in as an 
admin you’ll see a few options listed next to the album.  If you click on "edit files" you 
can put all sorts of information for each picture.</p>
<p><b>Question:</b>  I can delete the original pictures now, right?  After all, they are in the 
database.<br />
<b>Answer:</b>  Wrong!  Coppermine doesn’t actually put the pictures into the database.  It just 
uses the database to remember where the pictures are stored on the webserver, what 
album and category they belong to, and other information related to the pictures.  If you 
delete the original picture, it will cause a bunch of errors.  If you want to delete the 
original, read the documentation on what the Admin Tools are for.</p>
<p>You are now successfully running Coppermine on your website!  Now take a few 
minutes to read the documentation so you’ll know how to administer your gallery.  
Coppermine is very powerful and can do a lot of stuff you probably didn’t even think of.  
Experiment with it and have a good time!</p><br /><br />
