<h1>Categories</h1>
<p>In Coppermine, uploaded files go into albums. Albums can contain files, but not sub-albums. Albums can go into categories. Categories can contain sub-categories and albums, but they can not contain files.</p>
<p>Subsequently, categories are used to organize your gallery - use them to group your albums into logical units. It's up to you as gallery admin to provide an organizational structure of categories that provides your end users with a logical structure that makes it easy to navigate.</p>
<a name="cat_cp"></a><h2>The categories control panel<a href="#cat_cp" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<img src="pics/category_cp.gif" border="1" alt="" title="The category control panel" align="right" style="padding-left:5px;" />
<p>The category manager is available for the admin only. Only the admin can create categories.</p>
<p>This panel allows you to edit your categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <img src="pics/edit.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16" alt="" /> button
allows you to edit the title, description and parent category of an
existing cetegory.</li>
<li>The <img src="pics/delete.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="" /> button
allows you to delete a category. Deleting a category does not delete the
albums and files it contains. These are moved to the &quot;Root&quot;
category if it is a subcategory that is deleted or to the root of the category list if it is a parent category that is deleted..</li>
<li>The <img src="pics/up.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="" /> and <img
src="pics/down.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="" /> buttons allow you to
order your categories.</li>
<li>The &quot;<strong>Move into</strong>&quot; dropdown lists allow you to change the parent
of a specific category. </li></ul>
<p>&quot;<strong>User galleries</strong>&quot; is a special category. It is not visible unless you have some users that have created their own gallery. It can't be deleted but you can edit its title and description by using the <img src="pics/edit.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="" /> button. Determine wether users are allowed to have personal galleries that show up within the &quot;User galleries&quot; using the <a href="groups.htm#group_cp">groups control panel</a>.</p>
<p>You can specify how you want categories sorted in coppermine: alphabetically (instead of a customized order) by setting &quot;<a href="configuration.htm#admin_album_list_alphasort_start">Sort categories alphabetically</a>&quot; to &quot;Yes&quot;. This setting is available both in coppermine config and the category manager. If you enable alphabetical sorting, the move up and move down arrows that normally let you manually sort the categories will disappear. Disable this feature if you want to organize your categories in some other order.</p>
<p>You can only assign a picture to the category only if you have an album with images nested directly within it.</p>
