This plugin will override the default popup that embeds the fullsize picture and it will show a nice Lightbox popup instead.
It features a slideshow as well, you can navigate through the images in the selected album with the arrow keys or with your mouse.

Converted Sawey's mod, LightBox JS for Full Size Popup Slideshow, into a plugin.  This is my first attempt to do any work in PHP, so I cannot really support this plugin.  As I learn more about PHP, I expect to enhance this plugin with a configuration panel.
