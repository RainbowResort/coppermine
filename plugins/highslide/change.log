============================================= v2.4 - 2007/10/25 - 18:00 GMT
by Timos-Welt (http://www.timos-welt.de)

New features:
=============
- German language added
- Latest version of highslide.js by Torstein Hnsi (3.2.10), this will give you
  - better optics
  - better browser compatibility
  - animation uses less resources, especially with IE
  - fixed memory leak with IE
  For more information about changes of the java script, see http://vikjavev.no/highslide
- All css stuff is now in include/highslide.css to make it easier to adapt the optics
  to your own needs

Missing features from prev. version:
====================================
- I did _not_ change function and variable names in highslide.js to cpghs_... - if the plug in
  gives you javascript errors, please use v2.3 instead!

Fixes:
=======
- Fixed invalid XHTML if one thumbnail was diplayed twice on index page
  (e. g. in last uploaded _and_ top rated) by using $iCaptionCounter variable
  to avoid equal id attributes.
- Now compatible with funny file names if you want. Previous versions would not 
  open intermediate but full size picture if filename contained special
  characters (e. g. space, (, ), [, ] ...) - Coppermine can cope with these
  file names, so the plug in should as well. There's an additional option
  on the configuration page now to force highslide to always open the inter-
  mediate size. Better way would be to use an alternative to is_file, but I didn't
  find one. Come on you PHP experts! ;)
- highslide.js is delivered in a packed and unpacked version to save load time.
  If you want to do changes (e. g. change the slide parameters), use the un-
  packed version and rename it to highslide.js
- Parameter 'Apply to index & meta albums' and 'Apply to all pages' were wrong
  way round; changed these in the language files.

Known Issue:
=======
- Image view will still not count
- Will not work if you have custom title on thumbnails!
- Slightly different optics between IE, Firefox and Opera when using Caption (CSS problem?)



============================================= v2.5 - 2007/10/27 - 17:00 GMT
by Timos-Welt (http://www.timos-welt.de)

New features:
=============
- New Option to count views via Highslide as real views, so picture counter increases
  accordingly (experimental)
  IMPORTANT: For this to work, you MUST copy hscnt.php to your gallery root!

Still missing features from v 2.3:
==================================
- I did _not_ change function and variable names in highslide.js to cpghs_... - if the plug in
  gives you javascript errors, please use v2.3 instead!

Fixes:
=======
- Slightly different optics between IE, Firefox and Opera when using Caption (fixed)

Known Issue:
============
- Parameter 'Apply to index & meta albums' and 'Apply to all pages' are wrong
  way round when not in SEF compatibility mode
- Will not work if you have custom title on thumbnails!




============================================= v3.0 - 2007/10/29 - 22:30 GMT
by Timos-Welt (http://www.timos-welt.de)

New features:
=============
- Shorter URLs when 'count slide views as real views' turned on
- New config page with graphical color selection
- File names with special characters won't prevent loading of intermediate pictures
  (experimental)
- New layout 'Beleved'
- Selectable animation speed and resolution

Still missing features from v 2.3:
==================================
- I did _not_ change function and variable names in highslide.js to cpghs_... - if the plug in
  gives you javascript errors, please use v2.3 instead!
- I have no idea of JavaScript, so I simply can't do that. If you know JavaScript, feel free
  to change these beasts and mail them to me ( Timo at timos-welt.de ).

Fixes:
======
- Parameter 'Apply to index & meta albums' and 'Apply to all pages' were wrong
  way round when not in SEF compatibility mode - fixed
- Broken links to authors on config page - fixed
- Option 'Count views via Highslide as real views' used to count several times
  with Opera browser. In Opera, the picture counter was increased the 1st time 
  when loading the thumbnail page without doing anything else, the 2nd time when
  clicking on a thumb to enlarge it, the 3rd time when clicking on the enlarged
  pic to reduce it to thumb size. From now on, Opera users will not be
  counted via HighSlide at all, preventing false statistics. I have checked
  several other browsers (IE, FF, Safari) - none of them behaves this way - fixed
- Invalid XHTML with certain file names - fixed
- Moving 'loading' animation is finally back


Known Issues:
=============
- Will not work if you have custom title on thumbnails!
- If 'Link to intermediate' is set to 'yes', and visitor clicks on 'detail' link, 
  image counter will increase again, so his view will be counted twice.

by Timos-Welt (http://www.timos-welt.de)

New features:
=============

- Preview function and quite some JavaScript stuff on config page

Fixes:
======
