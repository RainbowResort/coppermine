What it is
----------

A minimalistic Content Mangement System which allows the gallery admin to
add / edit / delete pages. Typically this will be used by people who just want
to add a few pages like About, Contact etc to their installs of coppermine but
do not want full fledged CMS like Nuke.

It is also possible to include a category info page, which can be shown when a
user visits a specific category in your gallery.

It has FCKEditor WYSIWYG editor which works in IE and Mozilla, and respects the
admin rights from Coppermine.


INSTALL

  gallery's plugins folder.
