Add a checkbox under each thumbnail in an album, allowing a visitor to simply check the box to add images to their lightbox (Favorites), instead of opening the image, and adding it, then return to the main gallery. Is this possible, and if so, can someone give me some help with doing so. I'll probably more explanation than you'd expect.
