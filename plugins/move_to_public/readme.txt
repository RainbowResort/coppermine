Plugin version: 2.0
Plugin author: Borzoo Mossavari (Sami)
Plugin announcement thread: http://forum.coppermine-gallery.net/index.php/topic,54935.0.html


Because so many people ask how they can move user albums to public categories, I made a little plugin.

Just install it like every other plugin. A new button will appear in the admin menu.

Version 1.0 (2008-11-28):
- [new] plugin
- list all user albums (for admins only)
- move the selected album to the latest category (with the highest 'cid')
- [new] choose if the user can edit his files after moving or not
-> after moving to public, you can move it to a category you want, as you can do it with every other public album

Version 1.1.0 (2008-12-11):
- [bugfix] new owner name will be applied
- [improvement] choose where to move the selected album
- [improvement] choose which user will be the new owner of the moved files (or just leave the current user as owner)
- [new] move more than 1 album at a time
- [new] status page which lists the moving status and some links, relating to the moved album

Version 1.1.1 (2009-02-23):
- [improvement] show name of parent category in category list
