This plugin allows the visitor to non-destructively manipulate the image using new buttons on displayimage.php.

Available effect buttons:
 * reset
 * blur
 * b/w
 * lighten
 * darken
 * invert
 * emboss
 * flip vertically
 * flip horizontally


Browser compatibility:
The effects work fine with
 - IE 5.5+
 - Opera 9.5+
 - Firefox 2+
 - Chrome 3+
 - Safari
 - most other modern browsers should work, too or fall back without crashing

Please note:
 * Turn off 'add transparent overlay to avoid image theft' to make this plugin work.
 * This plugin and the plugin 'mirror' may not be used at the same time.
 * The buttons will only be available for visitors with javascript turned on. Others won't notice a thing.
