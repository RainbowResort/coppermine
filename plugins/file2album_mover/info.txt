What's it about:

When i started with coppermine the first thing i found a bit weird was that although Coppermine has a great
album facility, but the underlaying structure can be a mess. 

For example (a little scheme will do the trick):
                Album        Directory
Flower.jpg      Flowers      Flowers
Rose.jpg        Flowers      Trees
Oak.jpg         Trees        Flowers
deadtree.jpg    Trees        Trees

As you can see the albums don't correspond with the directories.
Well that's when File2AlbumMover comes in to place. It checks in which Album a picture it's in and then moves it 
to the directory with the same name. If that directory doen't exist, it creates it.

So after running File2AlbumMover the structure is as follows:
                Album        Directory
Flower.jpg      Flowers      Flowers
Rose.jpg        Flowers      Flowers
Oak.jpg         Trees        Trees
deadtree.jpg    Trees        Trees


What do you have to do:
- Unpack the files in a directory in the coppermine/plugin dir
- Modify the configuration.php and change $imagefolder variable. 
  At least it has to be / (/ stands for the first directory in the albums dir)
- Make sure you're logged in as admin
- Do not, i repeat do not install the plugin but start it as follows: /coppermine/index.php?file=f2am/codebase
  I'm still learning Coppermine and so installing will not be plesant.
  (f2am is the directory you put File2AlbumMover in)

Of course running this can be a bit tricky: 
- It's my first try at writing a plugin for Coppermine
- I'm not a crack at programming in PHP
- It's version 0.2(Machine Head)
So always make sure you backup your database and files!

Difference from v0.2 (Machine Head) to v0.3 (beta)
- Small bug fixed in the configuration.php file


Difference from v0.1 (Soulfly) to v0.2 (Machine Head)
- Created Log Facility:
		- Counting of how many files are moved
		- Color codes if copy/move went correct or not
		- Error_code to see what went wrong
- Better checking if all files are moved

Todo:
- Better integration with Coppermine (Can anyone explain how to do this?!)
- If the file has the same name, maybe change the filename and then move it
V Create a better log facility (First Start is made)
V Check before the files are deleted if they are really copied and/or the file is the same


Hope to hear from you with updates, Bug reports or even angry letters that you've lost your complete album ;)
