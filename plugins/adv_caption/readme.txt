This plugin is intended to provide more control over your thumbnail captions.  Right now, it only removes the date from the meta-albums that tack on the date automatically (with no configuration setting).  These albums are: My Favorites (favpics), Last Additions (lastup), Last Additions by User (lastupby), and Last Updated Albums (lastalb).  The date display for normal albums can be set on the admin configuration panel.

v1.01 - initial public release - removes date only for favpics, lastup, lastupby, and lastalb
