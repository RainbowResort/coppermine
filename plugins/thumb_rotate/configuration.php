$description='Rotates thumbnails for a different look of your gallery. The rotated thumbnails get cached in folder plugins/thumb_rotate/thumb_cache. Despite of that, this plugin is a CPU hog and shouldn\'t be used with large galleries or on slow servers. You can set the maximum amount of rotation and the background color of the generated thumbnails in codebase.php.';
