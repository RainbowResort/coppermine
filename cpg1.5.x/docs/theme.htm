<p>Coppermine comes with a powerful engine that allows you to <a href="theme_create.htm#theme_create">create your own theme</a>, giving your gallery a unique look that matches the overall layout of your entire site. Other applications call them &quot;skins&quot; or &quot;templates&quot;, well call them &quot;themes&quot;.</p>
<p>There is a (constantly growing) number of <a href="theme_user-contributions.htm#theme_user-contributions">user-contributed themes</a> that can be previewed and downloaded from the Coppermine web site.</p>

<a name="theme_builtin"></a><h2>Themes that come with Coppermine<a href="#theme_builtin" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>The Coppermine package comes with some pre-made themes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Classic</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_classic.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Classic" /><br />
  The default theme with white background and a horizontal menu</li>
  <li><strong>Eyeball</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_eyeball.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Eyeball" /><br />
  A theme with a dark background and a horizontal menu that expands for user interaction features</li>
  <li><strong>Fruity</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_fruity.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Fruity" /><br />
  A colorful theme with a vertical menu on the left</li>
  <li><strong>Hardwired</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_hardwired.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Hardwired" /><br />
  A theme with a dark background and a smallish font size that works well for narrow space and smaller resolutions. Comes with two horizontal menus</li>
  <li><strong>IGames</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_igames.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="igames" /><br />
  A dark theme with 3D-effects and a horizontal menu</li>
  <li><strong>Mac OX X</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_mac_ox_x.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Mac OX X" /><br />
  A theme with light background and an expanding horizontal menu that resembles the look of a Mac</li>
  <li><strong>Project VII</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_project_vii.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Project VII" /><br />
  A theme with white background featuring a horizontal expanding menu</li>
  <li><strong>Rainy Day</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_rainy_day.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Rainy Day" /><br />
  A theme with dark background and rounded edges</li>
  <li><strong>Sample</strong><br />
  The sample theme would look identical to the classic theme. It will not be displayed using the <a href="configuration.htm#admin_theme_theme_list">theme selector</a> - it is just meant as <a href="#theme_sample">a template to copy from</a> when creating or modifying your own theme.</li>
  <li><strong>Waterdrop</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_water_drop.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Waterdrop" /><br />
  A theme with a light background and a &quot;conventional&quot; horizontal menu</li>
</ul>

<a name="theme_upgrading"></a><h2>Upgrading your custom theme<a href="#theme_upgrading" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>To upgrade an existing custom theme from cpg1.4.x to version 1.5.x, read the <a href="theme_upgrade_14x-15x.htm">theme upgrade documentation</a>.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading from cpg1.3.x to cpg1.5.x, you will have to perform your theme upgrade in two steps: first, you need to upgrade your custom theme <a href="theme_upgrade_13x-14x.htm">from cpg1.3.x to cpg1.4.x</a> and then on <a href="theme_upgrade_14x-15x.htm">from cpg1.4.x to cpg1.5.x</a></p>
<p>You only have to upgrade your custom theme when upgrading between major versions (e.g. from cpg1.3.x to cpg1.4.x or from cpg1.4.x to cpg1.5.x), as from one major version to the next, the theming engine is subject to changes. When only upgrading from minor versions to the next (e.g. from cpg1.5.x to cpg1.5.y), you don't have to update your custom theme.</p>
<p>The core themes that come with Coppermine packages don't need to be updated, as they should be replaced during the upgrade and therefor will contain all needed changes. However: if you have based your custom theme on one of the core themes that come with coppermine (e.g. the classic theme), pay attention to possible changes. As suggested below, it's advisable to rename your custom theme to make sure that it doesn't accidentally get overwritten when upgrading.</p>

<a name="theme_files"></a><h2>Content of a theme<a href="#theme_files" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>Coppermine themes are stored in the &quot;<strong>themes</strong>&quot; directory, each consists of 3 primary files : </p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;<strong>template.html</strong>&quot; the main template in plain HTML.</li>
  <li>&quot;<strong>style.css</strong>&quot; the stylesheet associated with the template</li>
  <li>&quot;<strong>theme.php</strong>&quot; the PHP theme file</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, there usually is a folder named &quot;images&quot; that resides within the theme folder (themes/theme_name/images/) that contains the images used by the particular theme (logos, bullets, backgrounds and other graphical resources needed).</p>
<a name="theme_files_end"></a>

<a name="theme_sample"></a><h2>The sample theme - a template to copy from<a href="#theme_sample" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>Your Coppermine installation also includes a &quot;sample&quot; theme directory. The &quot;sample&quot; theme includes each of these files but does not show up in the user selectable list of themes in your Coppermine display. Sample's theme.php also holds a copy of every themeable function and template for your reference. If you opt to use the &quot;sample&quot; theme to begin creating your own theme, you should follow the theme.php instructions in the &quot;<a href="theme_upgrade_13x-14x.htm">theme upgrade documentation</a>&quot; and begin with a blank theme.php.</p>
<p>To clarify: you <strong>mustn't</strong> edit the sample theme (as it will not be displayed), but copy the sections you want to see changed from it into your custom theme. Don't copy the whole content from themes/sample/theme.php into your custom theme, as this will only clutter your custom theme and will make upgrading very hard in the future. Instead, copy the sections you want to modify.</p>
<a name="theme_sample_end"></a>

<a name="theme_engine"></a><h2>How the theme engine works<a href="#theme_engine" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>When a Coppermine page is being parsed, the core code will call theme functions. If those functions exist in your custom theme, they will be taken into account. If a particular function does not exist in your custom theme, the core function will be used. The core functions (the default theme behaviour if you want to put it that way) reside in includes/themes.inc.php. Therefor, you <strong>mustn't</strong> edit includes/themes.inc.php, under no circumstances, as all your changes will be lost when upgrading in the future. Everything that possibly could be accomplished by editing include/themes.inc.php can be accomplished by editing themes/yourtheme/theme.php as well - stuff defined in your custom theme will take precedence over the core theme functions.</p>
