<a name="theme"></a><h1>Themes<a href="#theme" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h1>
<p>Coppermine comes with a powerful engine that allows you to create your own theme, giving your gallery a unique look that matches the overall layout of your entire site. Other applications call them &quot;skins&quot; or &quot;templates&quot;, well call them &quot;themes&quot;.</p>

<a name="theme_builtin"></a><h2>Themes that come with Coppermine<a href="#theme_builtin" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>The Coppermine package comes with some pre-made themes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Classic</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_classic.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Classic" /><br />
  The default theme with white background and a horizontal menu</li>
  <li><strong>Eyeball</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_eyeball.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Eyeball" /><br />
  A theme with a dark background and a horizontal menu that expands for user interaction features</li>
  <li><strong>Fruity</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_fruity.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Fruity" /><br />
  A colorful theme with a vertical menu on the left</li>
  <li><strong>Hardwired</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_hardwired.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Hardwired" /><br />
  A theme with a dark background and a smallish font size that works well for narrow space and smaller resolutions. Comes with two horizontal menus</li>
  <li><strong>IGames</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_igames.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="igames" /><br />
  A dark theme with 3D-effects and a horizontal menu</li>
  <li><strong>Mac OX X</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_mac_ox_x.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Mac OX X" /><br />
  A theme with light background and an expanding horizontal menu that resembles the look of a Mac</li>
  <li><strong>Project VII</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_project_vii.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Project VII" /><br />
  A theme with white background featuring a horizontal expanding menu</li>
  <li><strong>Rainy Day</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_rainy_day.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Rainy Day" /><br />
  A theme with dark background and rounded edges</li>
  <li><strong>Sample</strong><br />
  The sample theme would look identical to the classic theme. It will not be displayed using the <a href="configuration.htm#admin_theme_theme_list">theme selector</a> - it is just meant as <a href="#theme_sample">a template to copy from</a> when creating or modifying your own theme.</li>
  <li><strong>Waterdrop</strong><br />
  <img src="pics/thumb_water_drop.png" width="100" height="75" border="0" alt="" title="Waterdrop" /><br />
  A theme with a light background and a &quot;conventional&quot; horizontal menu</li>
</ul>

<a name="theme_upgrading"></a><h2>Upgrading your custom theme<a href="#theme_upgrading" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>To upgrade an existing custom theme to version 1.5.x, read the <a href="theme_upgrade_13x-14x.htm">theme upgrade documentation</a>.</p>
<p>You only have to upgrade your custom theme when upgrading between major versions (e.g. from cpg1.3.x to cpg1.4.x or from cpg1.4.x to cpg1.5.x), as from one major version to the next, the theming engine is subject to changes. When only upgrading from minor versions to the next (e.g. from cpg1.5.x to cpg1.5.y), you don't have to update your custom theme.</p>
<p>The core themes that come with Coppermine packages don't need to be updated, as they should be replaced during the upgrade and therefor will contain all needed changes. However: if you have based your custom theme on one of the core themes that come with coppermine (e.g. the classic theme), pay attention to possible changes. As suggested below, it's advisable to rename your custom theme to make sure that it doesn't accidentally get overwritten when upgrading.</p>

<a name="theme_files"></a><h2>Content of a theme<a href="#theme_files" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>Coppermine themes are stored in the &quot;<strong>themes</strong>&quot; directory, each consists of 3 primary files : </p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;<strong>template.html</strong>&quot; the main template in plain HTML.</li>
  <li>&quot;<strong>style.css</strong>&quot; the stylesheet associated with the template</li>
  <li>&quot;<strong>theme.php</strong>&quot; the PHP theme file</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, there usually is a folder named &quot;images&quot; that resides within the theme folder (themes/theme_name/images/) that contains the images used by the particular theme (logos, bullets, backgrounds and other graphical resources needed).</p>
<a name="theme_files_end"></a>

<a name="theme_sample"></a><h2>The sample theme - a template to copy from<a href="#theme_sample" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>Your Coppermine installation also includes a &quot;sample&quot; theme directory. The &quot;sample&quot; theme includes each of these files but does not show up in the user selectable list of themes in your Coppermine display. Sample's theme.php also holds a copy of every themeable function and template for your reference. If you opt to use the &quot;sample&quot; theme to begin creating your own theme, you should follow the theme.php instructions in the &quot;<a href="theme_upgrade_13x-14x.htm">theme upgrade documentation</a>&quot; and begin with a blank theme.php.</p>
<p>To clarify: you <strong>mustn't</strong> edit the sample theme (as it will not be displayed), but copy the sections you want to see changed from it into your custom theme. Don't copy the whole content from themes/sample/theme.php into your custom theme, as this will only clutter your custom theme and will make upgrading very hard in the future. Instead, copy the sections you want to modify.</p>
<a name="theme_sample_end"></a>

<a name="theme_engine"></a><h2>How the theme engine works<a href="#theme_engine" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>When a Coppermine page is being parsed, the core code will call theme functions. If those functions exist in your custom theme, they will be taken into account. If a particular function does not exist in your custom theme, the core function will be used. The core functions (the default theme behaviour if you want to put it that way) reside in includes/themes.inc.php. Therefor, you <strong>mustn't</strong> edit includes/themes.inc.php, under no circumstances, as all your changes will be lost when upgrading in the future. Everything that possibly could be accomplished by editing include/themes.inc.php can be accomplished by editing themes/yourtheme/theme.php as well - stuff defined in your custom theme will take precedence over the core theme functions.</p>
<a name="theme_engine_end"></a>

<a name="theme_create"></a><h2>Creating your custom theme<a href="#theme_create" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>To create a new theme, the best solution is to use an existing one as its copy template. To do that, make a copy of the folder of the theme you want to use as a basis. Then edit the &quot;<strong>template.html</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>theme.php</strong>&quot; files and replace all occurences of &quot;<strong>themes/old_theme_dir</strong>&quot; with &quot;<strong>themes/new_theme_dir</strong>&quot; in order for the links to point to the correct place.<br />
Avoid using spaces and special chars in your custom theme name - only use alphanumerals and the underscore (_).</p>
<p>When editing the &quot;<strong>template.html</strong>&quot; file do not remove the elements between <strong>{}</strong> - these are the placeholders used by the script. Also keep in mind that despite this file being located in the &quot;<strong>themes/your_theme_dir</strong>&quot; directory, it must be coded as if it was in the main directory of the coppermine installation. For example, in order to display an image, you must use <tt class="code">&lt;img src=&quot;<strong>themes</strong>/theme_dir/images/image.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;</tt> and not just <tt class="code">&lt;img src=&quot;images/image.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;.</tt> The same principle applies for the &quot;<strong>theme.php</strong>&quot; file.</p>
<p>Be careful not to delete the line <tt class="code">&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="scripts.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</tt> - this javascript is necessary for the full-size pop-ups and other functions related to JavaScript.</p>
<p>If you are using an HTML editor to design your template, the easist working solution might be to the &quot;<strong>template.html</strong>&quot; file into the main directory of your coppermine installation and edit it there. Whenever you load Coppermine, if the script finds a file named &quot;<strong>template.html</strong>&quot; in the main directory it will load it instead of the default one that you assigned in the CONFIG menu. Once you have finished  editing your theme be sure to move the file back into the directory it belongs. Don't forget to remove the temporary template.html file from the Coppermine root folder once you are done editing!</p>
<p>To modify the colors, fonts, font sizes, etc... used by the script, you should edit the &quot;<strong>style.css</strong>&quot; stylesheet whenever possible. For example, if you want to increase or decrease the size of the fonts you can simply modify the line with : <tt class="code">table { font-size: 12px; }</tt>. Most of the font sizes used by the script are defined as a percentage of this size.</p>
<p>The &quot;<strong>theme.php</strong>&quot; file contains all the HTML templates used by the script. You can edit them, as well. When making modifications to these templates, be careful that you do not alter the lines that start with <tt class="code">&lt;!-- BEGIN xxx --&gt;</tt> and <tt class="code">&lt;!-- END xxx --&gt;</tt>. These lines are often used to identify the start and end of specific code blocks that the script will use to display your gallery.</p>
<p>If you're not sure how to go about creating your own theme, you could also have a look at the download section of the coppermine homepage: there are many user-contributed themes available for download that can be previewed on the <a href="http://coppermine-gallery.net/demo/">coppermine demo page</a>.</p>
<p>While you're in the process of creating or testing a new theme, you might not want your theme to be displayed to visitors of your site, but you (as the coppermine admin) may want to still be able to preview your theme. To do that, simply add <tt class="code">theme=your_theme_name</tt> to the url in your browser.</p>
<br />
<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li><tt class="code">http://yoursite.tld/coppermine/index.php?theme=your_theme_name</tt> will show the coppermine index page, using your theme</li>
<li><tt class="code">http://yoursite.tld/coppermine/thumbnails.php?album=1&amp;theme=your_theme_name</tt> will show the thumbnail view of album 1, using your theme</li>
<li><tt class="code">http://yoursite.tld/coppermine/?theme=xxx</tt> will reset your view back to the theme you chose as your default theme in coppermine config</li>
</ul>
