<p>To create a new theme, the best solution is to use an existing one as its copy template. To do that, make a copy of the folder of the theme you want to use as a basis. Then edit the &quot;<strong>template.html</strong>&quot;, &quot;style.css&quot; and &quot;<strong>theme.php</strong>&quot; files and replace all occurences of &quot;<strong>themes/old_theme_dir</strong>&quot; with &quot;<strong>themes/new_theme_dir</strong>&quot; in order for the links to point to the correct place.<br />
Avoid using spaces and special chars in your custom theme name - only use alphanumerals and the underscore (_).</p>
<div class="quote">
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Create a copy</strong><br />
  Browse the local coppermine gallery copy on your client, navigate to the themes folder (<tt class="code">your_coppermine_folder/themes/</tt>), right-click on the folder name that represents the theme you want to base your custom theme on (in this example, we will use the classic theme, so we will use <tt class="code">your_coppermine_folder/themes/classic/</tt>), select &quot;copy&quot; from the context menu. Then paste the content of the clipboard into the themes folder; a folder (named &quot;Copy of classic&quot; or similar) will turn up.</li>
  <li><strong>Rename the folder</strong><br />
  Right-click on the newly created folder (<tt class="code">your_coppermine_folder/themes/Copy of classic/</tt>) and select &quot; rename&quot; from the context menu. Choose a unique theme name - in this example, we will use &quot;my_theme&quot; (resulting in the folder to be renamed to <tt class="code">your_coppermine_folder/themes/my_theme/</tt>).<br />
  Keep in mind that we will upload the theme to your webserver later - you will have to make sure to properly use capitalization: on Windows-driven clients, capitalization does not matter, so there is no difference between &quot;<tt class="code">My_theme</tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt class="code">My_theme</tt>&quot;. Most webservers are Linux-driven though, where capitalization <em>does</em> matter (there <em>is</em> a difference between &quot;<tt class="code">My_theme</tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt class="code">My_theme</tt>&quot;). To be safe it is recommended to use lower case to stay out of harms way.</li>
  <li><strong>Edit the files to reflect the theme name</strong><br />
  Use a plain text editor (in this example, we will use notepad.exe), open <tt class="code">your_coppermine_folder/themes/my_theme/template.html</tt>. Find &quot;<tt class="code">themes/classic</tt>&quot; and replace with &quot;<tt class="code">themes/my_theme</tt>&quot; (may exist in the file several times, so make sure to replace <em>all</em> occurrences of &quot;<tt class="code">themes/classic</tt>&quot; with &quot;<tt class="code">themes/my_theme</tt>&quot;). Save your changes. Then do the same thing for the files <tt class="code">theme.php</tt> and <tt class="code">style.css</tt>.
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>It is strongly recommended to rename your custom theme as suggested above, even if you only plan to accomplish minor changes to a default theme that coppermine comes with. The reason is quite simple: when upgrading at a later stage, you will not run into issues (e.g. accidentally overwrite your customized theme with an updated default theme).</p>

<a name="theme_create_template_token"></a><h2>Template tokens<a href="#theme_create_template_token" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>When editing the &quot;<strong>template.html</strong>&quot; file do not remove the elements between <strong>{}</strong> - these are the placeholders used by the script. Also keep in mind that despite this file being located in the &quot;<strong>themes/your_theme_dir</strong>&quot; directory, it must be coded as if it was in the main directory of the coppermine installation. For example, in order to display an image, you must use <tt class="code">&lt;img src=&quot;<strong>themes</strong>/theme_dir/images/image.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;</tt> and not just <tt class="code">&lt;img src=&quot;images/image.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;.</tt> The same principle applies for the &quot;<strong>theme.php</strong>&quot; file.</p>
<p>Be careful not to delete the line <tt class="code">&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="scripts.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</tt> - this javascript is necessary for the full-size pop-ups and other functions related to JavaScript.</p>
<p>If you are using an HTML editor to design your template, the easist working solution might be to the &quot;<strong>template.html</strong>&quot; file into the main directory of your coppermine installation and edit it there. Whenever you load Coppermine, if the script finds a file named &quot;<strong>template.html</strong>&quot; in the main directory it will load it instead of the default one that you assigned in the CONFIG menu. Once you have finished  editing your theme be sure to move the file back into the directory it belongs. Don't forget to remove the temporary template.html file from the Coppermine root folder once you are done editing!</p>
<p>To modify the colors, fonts, font sizes, etc... used by the script, you should edit the &quot;<strong>style.css</strong>&quot; stylesheet whenever possible. For example, if you want to increase or decrease the size of the fonts you can simply modify the line with : <tt class="code">table { font-size: 12px; }</tt>. Most of the font sizes used by the script are defined as a percentage of this size.</p>
<p>The &quot;<strong>theme.php</strong>&quot; file contains all the HTML templates used by the script. You can edit them, as well. When making modifications to these templates, be careful that you do not alter the lines that start with <tt class="code">&lt;!-- BEGIN xxx --&gt;</tt> and <tt class="code">&lt;!-- END xxx --&gt;</tt>. These lines are often used to identify the start and end of specific code blocks that the script will use to display your gallery.</p>
<p>If you're not sure how to go about creating your own theme, you could also have a look at the download section of the coppermine homepage: there are many user-contributed themes available for download that can be previewed on the <a href="http://coppermine-gallery.net/demo/">coppermine demo page</a>.</p>
<p>While you're in the process of creating or testing a new theme, you might not want your theme to be displayed to visitors of your site, but you (as the coppermine admin) may want to still be able to preview your theme. To do that, simply add <tt class="code">theme=your_theme_name</tt> to the url in your browser.</p>

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
<li><tt class="code">http://yoursite.tld/coppermine/index.php?theme=your_theme_name</tt> will show the coppermine index page, using your theme</li>
<li><tt class="code">http://yoursite.tld/coppermine/thumbnails.php?album=1&amp;theme=your_theme_name</tt> will show the thumbnail view of album 1, using your theme</li>
<li><tt class="code">http://yoursite.tld/coppermine/?theme=xxx</tt> will reset your view back to the theme you chose as your default theme in coppermine config</li>
