<p>Coppermine has a separate language file that make the translation of the script much more easy. The language files are stored in the <strong>lang </strong>directory. The files are unicode encoded (utf-8). They are automatically generated with the <a href="http://www.iconv.com/iconv.htm" class="external">iconv</a> program so there is no need for you to make an unicode version of your translation.</p>
<p>If you select utf-8 to be the default encoding in coppermine's config, then the script will be able to automatically select a language file based on the visitor browser configuration.</p>
<p> If you have translated Coppermine into a language not already supported, please read the <a href="translation.htm">translator's guide</a> and visit the <a href="http://coppermine-gallery.net/forum/index.php?topic=20355.0">Coppermine Web Site</a> and follow the instructions for submitting your language.</p>

<a name="how"></a><h2>How languages work in Coppermine<a href="#how" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>Here's how coppermine determines the language of a user: when accessed, coppermine checks if a user explicitely has set a language preference (which is stored in a cookie on the client). If one is set, coppermine is being displayed in that particular language.</p>

<p>If no individual language preference has been set, coppermine detects the language preference of a user set up in his browser. If the browser language is (for example) English, then coppermine will display in English.</p>

<p>If the browser language is set to hindi (as an example), while there is no Coppermine language file available for that particular language, then coppermine will fall back to the default language you have set up in Coppermine's config.</p>

<p>As you can see, the determination of the actual language setting is a three step process:</p>
<ul>
<li>user preference (cookie)</li>
<li>browser setting</li>
<li>coppermine config setting</li>
</ul>
<p>This three-step-process is very helpful: in fact, you only set a default language in Coppermine's config (usually the language the majority of your visitors is speaking) and that's it: if a visitor who speaks another language visits your page, Coppermine's controls will display in his language. Usually, you don't have to provide a <a href="configuration.htm#admin_language_list">language selector</a> on your page (but it's an option in Coppermine's config to display one if you prefer so). The language selector in fact just adds a parameter to the URL, which then subsequently triggers a cookie to be set on the client. You (as Coppermine admin) can accomplish the same by manually adding the parameter to the URL in the address bar of your browser. Just observe how the URL changes on the your coppermine gallery if you have enabled the language selector in coppermine's config to get an idea how this works.</p>
