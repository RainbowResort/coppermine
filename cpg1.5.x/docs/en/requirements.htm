<p>There are certain <strong>minimum requirements</strong> that need to be met in order to be able to install Coppermine:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A web server that supports PHP</strong><br />
  PHP (version 4.2.0 or better), either compiled with the support for the GD library or permission to use the exec() function for the ImageMagick &quot;convert&quot; utility in order to make thumbnails and reduced size images. Mysql support needs to be compiled into PHP as well.</li>
  <li><strong>A MySQL database</strong><br />
  You will need MySQL version 3.23.23 or better. MySQL 4.1 is recommended, MySQL 5 is supported. The MySQL user needs permissions to perform CREATE, ALTER, REPLACE, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT data from the database. Most users have these permissions when webhosted. If you don't have them, you will not be able to use this or any other pre-made scripts at all. If you are uncertain about your permissions, please check with your webhost. Most hosting services can probably tell you whether coppermine can or cannot be run on their servers.<br />
  A database needs to be set up that Coppermine can use - the install script will <strong>not</strong> create a database for you, but it will automatically create the tables and data structure in your database during install. In most webhosted environments, you will already have at least one database set up for you by your webhost. If not, you will need to create one. If you do need to create a database, check with your webhost on the proper procedures for doing so. Write down your database name, userID and password. You will require all three to successfully install Coppermine. </li>
  <li><strong>An image library:</strong><br />
  Either GD version 1.x or 2.x (PHP has to be compiled to support it) or ImageMagick.<br />
  (see <a href="install_faq.htm#whatIsImageMagick">What's ImageMagick</a> and <a href="install_faq.htm#WhatIsGD">What is GD</a>)</li>
  <li>It's always a good idea to contact your webhosting service first and ask them if they are aware of any known issues when installing Coppermine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Coppermine can be run on <em>any</em> webserver that has the minimum requirements mentioned above, the Coppermine dev team can not support you on setting up your webserver in the first place. As suggested, those are requirements, i.e. they have to be met before actually considering to run Coppermine. Please note that the Coppermine group does not recommend self-hosting unless you're an experienced webserver administrator and know your way around.</p>

<p>Coppermine is aimed at webmasters who have at least basic HTML know-how and some experience in setting up pre-made scripts. The Coppermine dev team is aware that there are Coppermine users who set up their gallery using <a href="auto-installers.htm">auto-installers</a> who have little or no experience in setting up similar scripts, which is fine as well. We just ask you to read the documentation thoroughly before asking questions on the Coppermine support board, as this should answer most newbie questions. You can use coppermine just fine using the <a href="theme.htm#theme_builtin">pre-made themes that come with the coppermine package</a>. However, if you want to modify existing themes or <a href="theme_create.htm#theme_create">come up with a theme of your own</a> (that matches the look of the rest of your site), you should have basic to intermediate <acronym title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</acronym> and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> skills.</p>
