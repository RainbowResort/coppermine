<a name="theme_matching"></a><h1>Creating a Coppermine theme that matches your overall site layout<a href="#theme_matching" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Coppermine can do many amazing things. One of the things that can't be done easily with coppermine is calling it via PHP's include command, so this is not an option. What could you do then? Some people decide to put coppermine into a frame or iframe within their overall site, which works as expected, but is not a good idea: all drawbacks that apply to the use of frames (or inline frames) of course apply to this solution as well. So what's the prefered method to make your coppermine-driven gallery blend nicely into your overall site layout: you have to create a coppermine theme that matches the overall layout of your page.</p>
<p>This section is meant to explain how to accomplish this easily.</p>
<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
<p>To be able to use this tutorial-like section of the coppermine docs, you need to fullfill some basic requirements:</p>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Browser<br />
    Obviously, you have one - you couldn't read this document otherwise. The coppermine dev team recommends using <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/" rel="external" class="external">Firefox</a> along with the <a href="dev_tools.htm#dev_tools_web_developer">web developer toolbar</a></li>
    <li>Editor<br />
    You need a plain-text editor. If you're running Windows, you can use notepad.exe, but we recommend a better tool like <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/" rel="external" class="external">Notepad++</a>. <acronym title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</acronym>-editors like Frontpage or Dreamweaver don't fall into the category "plain-text editors" and mustn't be used when editing Coppermine-files, as they tend to modify the code although they should not.</li>
    <li>FTP-application<br />
    Of course, you need to be able to upload your custom theme to your webserver, so you need a proper FTP app (you probably already have one if you already have a web page of your own)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Basic HTML and CSS skills are all you need. You don't need to know/understand PHP to come up with a custom theme</li>
    <li>Readiness to spend some time on this: a skilled coder can come up with a custom coppermine theme that is based on a theme that already exists in some minutes. Fine-tuning may take longer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, I will use the open source web design "Cloudy Water Sports" created by "boilers" from <a href="http://360guide.info/" rel="external" class="external">http://360guide.info/</a> as an example. It has been taken from the great resource <a href="http://www.oswd.org" rel="external" class="external">www.oswd.org</a> and is available free of charge.</p>
<p>Since it is an extremely lightweight theme used for demonstration (and not filled with any content that makes sense), it has been added to the documentation - preview it <a href="tutorial/cloudywatersports/index.html">here</a> (you better open this link in a separate browser tab or window, since we'll need it during this tutorial).</p>
<h2>Pick a similar theme first</h2>
<p>The first step would be to pick a theme that matches your site's design the most in terms of layout. For this purpose, you can choose one from the themes that come with the coppermine package or get a <a href="theme_user-contributions.htm#theme_user-contributions">user-contributed theme</a>.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I will use the <strong>classic</strong> theme as an example to build upon.</p>
<p>As suggested in the section "<a href="theme_create.htm#theme_create_rename">Rename your theme first</a>", you mustn't start editing the classic theme right away, but create a copy of that theme. This step is vital to be safe for future updates. For this tutorial we assume that you have done as suggested and renamed your copy of the classic theme to "my_theme".</p>
<p>Apply the other steps as well: fire up your text editor, open themes/my_theme/template.html and do a <tt class="code">find/replace</tt> on the string &quot;<tt class="code">classic</tt>&quot; (without the quotes) and replace that with the string &quot;<tt class="code">my_theme</tt>&quot; (again without the quotes). Save your changes, but don't close the editor yet - we still need it.</p>
