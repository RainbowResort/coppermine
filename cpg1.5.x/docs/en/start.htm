<a name="getting"></a><h1>Getting started<a href="#getting" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h1>
<p>Use the &quot;<strong><a href="albums.htm#albmgr">Album Manager</a></strong>&quot; (&quot;Albums&quot; link in the admin menu) in to create and order your albums. You'll need at least one album your files can go into.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>anonymous</strong> group to define what non-registered users can and can't do (in the <a href="groups.htm#group_cp">groups</a> panel).</p>
<p>Use the <strong><a href="albums.htm#modif_alb_pics">properties</a></strong> of an album to modify its description and permissions.
</p>
<p>In order for a user to be allowed to upload a file in album two conditions must be met:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The user must be part of a <a href="groups.htm#group_cp">group</a> that can upload files.</li>
  <li>There must be at least one album where &quot;<strong>Visitors can upload files</strong>&quot; has been set to &quot;<strong>Yes</strong>&quot;,<br /> <strong>OR</strong> <br />The user has created an album in the 'user galleries', if allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same applies to <strong>picture rating</strong> and <strong>comment posting</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have installed the script succesfully but are having trouble getting it working properly you can enable the &quot;<strong><a href="configuration.htm#debug_mode">debug mode</a></strong>&quot; on the <strong>Config page</strong>. In this mode, the script outputs most of the warning/error messages produced by PHP in addition to some debug information. This can provide valuable information to understand what is wrong.</p>



<a name="getting_concepts"></a><h2>Basic concepts<a href="#getting_concepts" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>Of course you're exited about Coppermine and want to start with it right now. However, there are some basic considerations you should make up your mind about first, as some settings can't be changed easily once your gallery has been populated with content.</p>
<p>So this section is meant as a guide once you've finished <a href="install.htm#installation">installing</a> Coppermine. Go through it carefully to avoid issues that may turn up later.</p>
<ul>
        <li><strong><a href="#getting_initial_configuration">Initial configuration</a></strong><br />
        Settings you should edit immediately after finishing the install</li>
        <li><strong><a href="#getting_structure">Category/album/file structure</a></strong><br />

        Make sure uploading works as expected before letting in visitors</li>
        <li><strong><a href="#getting_consider_bridging">Consider bridging</a></strong><br />
        Bridging later when you already have users might get difficult</li>
        <li><strong><a href="#getting_interaction">What are your visitors allowed to do?</a></strong><br />
        What level of user interaction are you going to allow?</li>

</ul>



<a name="getting_initial_configuration"></a><h2>Initial configuration<a href="#getting_initial_configuration" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>There are some settings in Coppermine's config that you should edit right after finishing install.</p>
<p>Log in with the admin username and password you set up during install, click on the &quot;Show admin controls&quot; link if it is visible, go to the <strong>Config</strong> page and start to configure your gallery. Note that even if you are a member of the administrator group, you need to have &quot;Show admin controls&quot; enabled. In previous versions, this used to be named &quot;admin mode&quot;, but was renamed because some people thought that switching from admin mode to user mode showed them what regular users can see (which is not the case).</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="configuration.htm#admin_general_email">Gallery administrator email</a></li>
  <li><a href="configuration.htm#admin_general_coppermine-url">URL of your coppermine gallery folder</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are some settings in config that can't be changed later (if there are already files in the database) - make sure to set them up correctly in the first place. Although you'll surely want to start using coppermine immediately it is advisable to configure those settings (marked with an asterisk &quot;*&quot;) properly at the very beginning.</p>

<a name="getting_structure"></a><h2>Category, albums and file structure<a href="#getting_structure" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>The Coppermine Photo Gallery works in the following way:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Files are stored in albums</li>
  <li>Albums are organised in categories</li>
  <li>Categories can be nested (into subcategories)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't plan to have many albums, you really won't need to use the categories feature. If this applies to you, simply do not create any categories and all your albums will automatically appear on the main page of the script.</p>
<p>There is, however, a special category named &quot;<strong>User galleries</strong>&quot;. This category can't be deleted. If a user belongs to the group &quot;can have a personal gallery&quot; and this is set to YES, he will have the right to create his own albums and his gallery will be a sub-category of &quot;User galleries&quot;. This link is not visible to visitors of your site, however, if you do not allow users to upload pics and have their own albums. </p>
<p>The administrator can create albums in any category. Non-administrative users can only create albums in the &quot;User galleries/Their_username&quot;.</p>
<p>You can, however rename the &quot;User Galleries&quot;. To rename the &quot;<strong>User galleries</strong>&quot; category and description, simply go to your <a href="#cat_cp">category control panel</a> and change the name there (e.g. to translate the words &quot;User galleries&quot; into your language).</p>

<a name="getting_admin_account"></a><h2>Your admin account<a href="#getting_admin_account" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>It's mandatory to have your admin account configured properly and to memorize the admin account data. Coppermine even provides you with the option to retrieve a lost password, but for this, you have to configure an email address for every account. When users sign up, they have to enter an email address, so this should not be a problem. However, the admin account that you created during setup doesn't have an email account yet. You should go to your profile when logged in as admin and specify a valid email address for the admin there - this way, you can later request a new password if you forget it.</p>
<p>To make this absolutely clear: there are at least two places where you must specify an email address in Coppermine:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the first place is the config option &quot;<a href="configuration.htm#admin_general_email">Gallery administrator email</a>&quot;. Coppermine will use this address as "from"-address when sending emails (e.g. during registration). It's mandatory to have this email address populated properly. If you have your own domain, it might be a good idea to use an email account that correlates to your domain name.</br>
    Example: if your domain name is &quot;example.com&quot;, you should create an email address named gallery@example.com and use that email address in coppermine's config. Coppermine does <strong>not</strong> create that email address for you!</li>
    <li>the second place is the profile of your admin account: you should set up an email address for that account as well. This could be any sort of email address - provided it is one that you actually constantly monitor.</li>
</ul>
<p>It won't hurt if those two email addresses are the same: they can be the same or they can differ. Just make sure to populate both.</p>



<a name="getting_check_uploads"></a><h2>Check uploads<a href="#getting_check_uploads" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>Before actually promoting your coppermine gallery publicly, you should make sure that uploads work as expected, as they are the most common issues users have, caused by the huge amount of factors that have to be taken into account. Review the <a href="upload_troubleshooting.htm">upload troubleshooting section</a> if you have issues.</p>



<a name="getting_consider_bridging"></a><h2>Consider bridging<a href="#getting_consider_bridging" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>Coppermine was designed to be used as standalone application in the first place. However, many people wanted to integrate it with another app, so starting with cpg1.1.x coppermine came with a mechanism that allowed users to bridge coppermine with another app in terms of user management. The main advantage is giving your site visitors a single sign-on for your overall site (e.g. both in your gallery and your forum), so they don't have to sign in twice and memorize two different logons.</p>
<p>Bridging does <strong>not</strong> integrate coppermine visually into your home page (you have to <a href="theme.htm#creating">create a custom theme</a> to accomplish this).</p>
<p>You can enable (or disable) bridging at any time, but you should make up your mind on bridging when installing Coppermine in the first place, because there are some issues that have to be taken into account: if you already have users inside your coppermine database when enabling bridging, the correlation between those initial coppermine users and the "new" users from the app you bridge with gets lost. As a consequence, there will be no more correlation between things your "old" users did (uploading pic, posting comments etc.) and the "new" users from the bridge.</p>
<p>To circumvent those future issues, you should make up your mind when installing coppermine: do you want to allow user interaction? Do you plan to offer a bulletin board later (or any other application that keeps track of users)? If your answer is "yes", or "maybe", then it's advisable to enable bridging before actually promoting your site publicly and starting to let users in.</p>
<p>Read up details in the <a href="bridging.htm#integrating">bridging section</a> of the docs.</p>



<a name="getting_interaction"></a><h2>What are your visitors allowed to do?<a href="#getting_interaction" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>Coppermine can be used for a variety or purposes: some use it to display their personal files to everyone on the internet, others want only a limited number of users to be able to access the site for viewing only and no interaction at all. A large number of webmasters want to create a community site, where users can participate by uploading files, comment on other's files and rate them.</p>
<p>You can use Coppermine in all those setups (and a mixture of it), but you should be aware of the possibilities and limitations first:</p>
<p>Users &quot;inherit&quot; their permissions from the group they're in. That's why many settings in Coppermine are set per group. This way, you can have several levels of permissions. Set permissions by group using the <a href="groups.htm#group_cp">group control panel</a></p>


<a name="getting_design"></a><h2>Change your coppermine's design<a href="#getting_design" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>You can change some layout and design aspects (e.g. <a href="configuration.htm#admin_album_list_content">displaying random thumbnails on the index page</a>) in the corresponding <a href="configuration.htm">config</a> section. Coppermine comes with a <a href="theme.htm#theme_engine">theme engine</a> that allows you to customize the look of your gallery. You can choose one of the themes that come with Coppermine or you can download user-contributed themes from the downloads section of the Coppermine homepage. Based on the available themes you can <a href="theme_create.htm#theme_create">customize your individual theme</a> to make your site look unique and make your gallery match the overall look of your site.</p>

<a name="getting_typical"></a><h2>Typical setups<a href="#getting_typical" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>There are a lot of configuration options built into coppermine - use them wisely. As many users ask for a <em>typical</em> setup (although there is no such thing as <em>the</em> typical setup that fits for anybody), here's just a couple of them:</p>

<a name="getting_typical_monolithic"></a><h3>Single uploader <em>without</em> user interaction (Monolithic gallery)<a href="#getting_typical_monolithic" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h3>
<p><em>Only one uploader (you) and little or no user interaction</em><br />
If you're going to be the only uploader and want little or no user interaction at all, disallow your site's visitors anything you don't want them to do. This is usually the case if you're an artist or photographer: there is no community building behind your gallery - you just show to the public what content you have.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Disable new user registration in coppermine's config (<span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Configuration &rarr; Registration &rarr; Allow new user registrations</span>). This will disable the "register" link in the navigation. Users manually going to the registration page will see a message telling them that they are not allowed to perform this operation</li>
    <li>Disable creation of new albums for users (<span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Groups &rarr; Row &quot;Registered&quot; &rarr; Personal gallery &rarr; Allowed = no</span>) in case you haven't disabled the registration from the start and there are some leftover users registered.</li>
    <li>Disallow visitors to upload by going to the groups control panel and setting &quot;Public albums upload&quot; to be not allowed: <span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Groups &rarr; Row &quot;Guests&quot; &rarr; Public albums upload &rarr; Allowed = no</span>. If guests (or any user group) is disallowed to have personal galleries and to upload to public albums, the &quot;upload file&quot; link in the navigation will no longer be displayed.
    <li>If you don't want your visitors to interact by <strong>rating</strong>, turn rating off on the groups control panel for the guests/anonymous group: <span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Groups &rarr; Row &quot;Guests&quot; &rarr; Permissions &rarr; Rating = no</span>. If rating is disabled, users won't see the rating stars where they could vote.</li>
    <li>If you don't want your visitors to post comments, turn comments off for guests: <span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Groups &rarr; Row &quot;Guests&quot; &rarr; Permissions &rarr; Comments = no</span>.</li>
    <li>If you don't want your visitors to <strong>send ecards</strong>, disable the sending of ecards in the groups control panel as suggested above: <span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Groups &rarr; Row &quot;Guests&quot; &rarr; Permissions &rarr; Ecards = no</span></li>
<ul>

<a name="getting_typical_single_uploader_community"></a><h3>Single uploader <em>with</em> user interaction<a href="#getting_typical_single_uploader_community" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h3>
<p>If you're going to be the only uploader, but you want to build a community around your site, with visitor registering, posting comments etc., just turn off uploads for your users, but turn on all the other feature that you want to allow:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Turn off all kinds of uploads for guests as well as registered users: 
        <ul>
            <li><span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Groups &rarr; Row &quot;Guests&quot; &rarr; Personal gallery &rarr; Allowed = no</span></li>
            <li><span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Groups &rarr; Row &quot;Registered&quot; &rarr; Personal gallery &rarr; Allowed = no</span></li>
            <li><span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Groups &rarr; Row &quot;Guests&quot; &rarr; Public albums upload &rarr; Allowed = no</span></li>
            <li><span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Groups &rarr; Row &quot;Registered&quot; &rarr; Public albums upload &rarr; Allowed = no</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        To avoid comment spam you should disallow comments for guests, but allow those features for registered users:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Groups &rarr; Row &quot;Guests&quot; &rarr; Permissions &rarr; Comments = no</span></li>
            <li><span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Groups &rarr; Row &quot;Registered&quot; &rarr; Permissions &rarr; Comments = yes</span></li>
            <li>To fight comment spam you should enable comment approval and/or captcha for comments.<br />
            To enable comment approval, go to coppermine's config and change the corresponding setting: <span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Configuration &rarr; Comment settings &rarr; Comments require approval</span>.<br />
            Additionally (or alternatively), you should enable <acronym title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">captcha</acronym> (a sort of image that displays scrambled, random letters that the visitor has to read and enter into an input field to prove that he is human and not just a silly bot script) for comments as well: <span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Configuration &rarr; Comment settings &rarr; Display Captcha (Visual Confirmation) for adding comments</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Allow visitors to rate your content: you enable rating on per group level. Therefor, go to the groups control panel and allow rating for all possible groups:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Groups &rarr; Row &quot;Guests&quot; &rarr; Permissions &rarr; Rating = yes</span></li>
            <li><span class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Groups &rarr; Row &quot;Registered&quot; &rarr; Permissions &rarr; Rating = yes</span></li>
        </ul>
        You have to understand though that this is not all: think of those per-group settings as a general on/off switch. You can fine-tune those settings per individual album: you can allow rating in one album and deny it in another one. Go to the <a href="albums.htm#album_prop">album properties</a> of an individual album to allow/disallow ratings for this particular album.
    </li>
</ul>
