<a name="batch_add_pics"></a><h1>Uploading pics by FTP / Batch-Add Pictures<a href="#batch_add_pics" title="Link to this section"><img src="images/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h1>
<p>It is recommended that the coppermine admin use ftp to upload multiple pics/files at a time. Use your ftp software to create sub-folders within <em>your_coppermine_directory/albums/</em>, where your ftp uploads can be saved. Though not mandatory, it's always a good idea to have a folder structure within the <em>albums</em> folder that reflects or mirrors your coppermine categories and albums.</p><p><span class="important">Important</span>: do not create folders or ftp upload to the <em>userpics</em>- nor to the <em>edit</em>-folder by ftp: these folders are used by coppermine internally and must not be used for any other purpose! <strong><strong>Folder names must not contain dots</strong></strong>. We also highly recommend refraining from the use of any other special characters - use only a-z, numbers and <tt class="code">-</tt> (dashes) or <tt class="code">_</tt> (underscores) to fill blank spaces. Make sure to upload in binary or auto-mode.</p>
<p>Once you have uploaded your photos by ftp, click on the &quot;Batch Add Pictures&quot; button. The batch-add is performed in three steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>find the directory under which you have uploaded your photos. Select this directory by clicking on it.
<br /><img src="images/searchnew_1.gif" border="0" alt="" /><a name="ftp_select_dir_end"></a></li>
<li><a name="ftp_select_file"></a>select the photos you wish to upload (by ticking them).  New pics are automatically pre-selected, those that already are in your coppermine database are not selected. Next select the album you wish to insert them into. Click &quot;Insert Selected Pictures&quot; to start the batch-add process.<br />
<img src="images/searchnew_2.gif" border="0" alt="" /><a name="ftp_select_file_end"></a></li>
<li><a name="ftp_show_result"></a>CPG will then display the results of the batch-add (allow some time for all results to display).<br />
If the OK, DP, or PB 'signs' does not appear, click on the broken file image to see if any error message was produced by PHP.<br />
Should your browser time out, hit the reload button.
<ul>
<li>OK : means that the file was succesfully added</li>
<li>DP : means that the file is a duplicate and is already in the database</li>
<li>PB : means that the file could not be added, check your configuration and the permission of directories where the files are located</li>
<li>NA : means that you haven't selected an album the files should go to, hit 'back' and select an album. If you don't have an album create one first</li>
</ul>
<a name="ftp_show_result_end"></a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Giving FTP-access to other users can pose a serious security threat, this is why batch-add is only available for the coppermine gallery admin.</p>
<p>Once files have been added to coppermine's database, make sure that you never rename or delete them via ftp - use coppermine's admin menu options to remove or rename files, instead.  Only in this way will these files be removed from both the file system <strong>and</strong> the database.</p>
