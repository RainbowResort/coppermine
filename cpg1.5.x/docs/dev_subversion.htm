<p>As Coppermine is a community effort, with various developers working on it simultaneously, there is the need to have a tool that allows the developers to organize their submissions.</p>

<a name="dev_subversion_target_audience"></a><h2>Target audience<a href="#dev_subversion_target_audience" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>This part of the documentation is not meant for end users of Coppermine, meaning: you don't have to read this nor do you (as end user) have to check out the Subversion repository. However: if you know your way around in Coppermine and would like to see the bleeding edge of Coppermine technology, you're welcome to read this page and check out Coppermine using Subversion access. Primary target audience for this page are coppermine developers though.</p>

<a name="dev_subversion_caveat"></a><h2>Caveats<a href="#dev_subversion_caveat" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>As suggested in the <a href="testing.htm">testing docs</a>, you (as an end user) are welcome to check out the development versions of Coppermine. However, you have to understand that both subversion access as well as development versions go completely, utterly unsupported.</p>

<a name="dev_subversion_definition"></a><h2>What is subversion?<a href="#dev_subversion_definition" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>Subversion is a revision control system which allows computer software to be developed in an incremental and controlled fashion by a distributed group of programmers. Also commonly referred to as svn or SVN, Subversion is designed specifically to be a modern replacement for CVS. Subversion was created by <a href="http://www.collab.net/" rel="external" class="external">CollabNet</a>, who still maintain the project.</p>

<a name="dev_subversion_hosting"></a><h2>Where is the subversion repository hosted?<a href="#dev_subversion_hosting" title="Link to this section"><img src="pics/anchor.gif" width="15" height="9" border="0" alt="" /></a></h2>
<p>Setting up and maintaining a subversion server is something that you can't accomplish on a &quot;regular&quot; webserver (on shared webhosting). That's why the Coppermine group has decided to host the subversion repository at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/" rel="external" class="external">sourceforge.net</a>, who provide hosting and services for many open source projects. Originally, the Coppermine project started using Sourceforge's CVS services and later moved to SVN.</p>
