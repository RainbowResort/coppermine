<a name="admin"><h2>The gallery configuration page</h2></a>
<p>This is where you will configure the most important parts of your coppermine gallery. Some settings have an impact on the files you upload - changing the ( * ) asterisked options after you have alreaded added a large number of files in your gallery can be a difficult undertaking. For this reason, it is important that you spend time with your coppermine setup at the early stages of gallery development to get those settings exactly the way you want them, before actually uploading too many pics or listing the gallery to the general public.</p>


<a name="admin_general"><h3>General settings</h3></a>

<p>This is the URL where a user will be directed to when s/he clicks on the &quot;See more pictures&quot; link in an e-card. This <em>must</em> be the URL to the root of your coppermine installation followed by a forward slash (just the path to your coppermine folder, e.g. <em>http://yourdomain.tld/coppermine/</em>). Do not specify a specific file (such as index.php) or subfolder within the coppermine gallery in this field.</p><p>In previous versions of Coppermine, this field was called &quot;Target address for the 'See more pictures' link in e-cards&quot;, but as this url is now being used for other functions in coppermine, it has been changed, appropriately.</p>

<a name="admin_general_zip-download"><h4>Allow ZIP-download of favorites</h4></a>
<p>When enabled, users of your site may download files that they previously saved into their <em>favorites</em> collection. These files are dowloaded from the user's &quot;My favorites&quot; page and saved onto their computers in a zip-file format. This option requires zlib to be installed on your server (run <a href="http://www.php.net/phpinfo" class="external">phpinfo</a> to check if this php library file exists on your server).</p>

<hr />
<a name="admin_general_encrypt_password_start"><h4>Enable encrypted passwords</h4></a>
<p>This option affects changes on user passwords that are stored as plain text in your database (this is the case if you have upgraded from previous versions of coppermine that did not have this feature). It will encrypt all passwords in the database, and all future passwords will be stored encypted as well. This process can not be reversed: once encryption is turned on, it can not be turned off, so use this option only after giving it some serious consideration.</p>
<p>This option increases user security in coppermine, but comes with a drawback inherent to this method: even the admin will not be able to recover a lost password of a user (or his own password). The password can only be reset to another value using the "I forgot my password" option during login.</p>
<p>This option is only available if you have upgraded your coppermine install from cpg1.0 to cpg1.3.x. More recent versions (cpg1.4.x or better) encrypt the passwords by default, so this option will not be shown.</p>
<p class="navlocator" style="text-align:right;color:#0E72A4;">Configuration &rarr; General settings &rarr; Enable encrypted passwords</p>
<a name="admin_general_encrypt_password_end"></a>
<hr />
<a name="admin_general_help"><h4>Enable help-icons</h4></a>
<p>Enables the display of help icons in various sections of the coppermine admin pages. When enabled, make sure you have also uploaded the "docs" folder into your coppermine folder on your webserver.</p>
<p>If you choose to set this to &quot;Yes: everyone&quot;, logged in (registered) users will be able to see the help icons in strategic locations as well, e.g. when creating a user gallery.</p>
<p>As the help text is based on the documentation that comes with coppermine, it is available in English only. If the native language of your user(s) is not English, it is advisable to set this option to &quot;Yes: admin only&quot; to avoid confusion among your users.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that you do not disable the help icons altogether: even though you feel that you know your way around in your Coppermine install, the help icons might help you with the functinos of a new or unfamiliar option later.</p>

<a name="admin_general_keywords_start"><h4>Enable clickable keywords in search</h4></a>
<p>When enabled, a list of all keywords entered in the &quot;<a href="files.htm#edit_pics">Edit files</a>&quot; page will appear at the bottom of the search page, with each keyword being a clickable search link. Enabling this option is recommended only if you have a small number of keywords in use (e.g. less than 100) - it will provide your users with some ideas as to what they could be searching for in your gallery (in addition to the standard full-text search). Please note that enabling this option for a large list of keywords (e.g. thousands of keywords) can slow down the search page considerably and may be confusing for new users and visitors to your site.</p>

<a name="admin_general_enable-plugins"><h4>Enable plugins</h4></a>
<p>Enable or disable <a href="#plugin">plugins</a>, with a link to the <a href="plugins.htm#plugin_manager">plugin manager</a>. This is a brand-new feature of coppermine. This feature allows advanced copperminers to create plug-ins that can control the way coppermine looks and behaves without modifying the inherent code of the script itself. We anticipate many exciting, user-contributed, plug-ins in the near future.  More details can be found in the <a href="plugins.htm#plugin_start">plugins section of this documentation</a>.  Since plugins add on to the core Coppermine system, if you are having problems, try to disable all plugins using this setting to see if a plugin may be at fault.  If so, you can then enable all plugins here, then uninstall or install one plugin at a time in the <a href="plugins.htm#plugin_manager">plugin manager</a> to figure out which one is at fault.</p>

<a name="admin_general_private-ip"><h4>Allow banning of non-routable (private) IP addresses</h4></a>
<p>Today, most people on the internet have dynamic IP addresses that are assigned to them when connecting to the internet by their Internet Service Provider. These IP adresses change each time the user connects to the internet, but during an internet session these IP addresses are &quot;visible&quot; at the web-sites that thee user is surfing. Within the range of all IP adresses (0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255), certan ranges are reserved for special purposes (mostly for the use on private networks). The banning feature will not accept IP adresses banning of addresses that belong to these private ranges (e.g. 192.168.0.1). This is necessary to prevent unexperienced, as well as experienced, coppermine admins from banning IP addresses within their own LAN. If you're actually running Coppermine on your LAN/WAN that uses private IP addresses (e.g. on a company's intranet) and you want the authority to be able to ban users, switch this option to &quot;Yes&quot;. If you're running coppermine on a webserver located in the internet (e.g. you're webhosted), you should keep this option set to &quot;No&quot;.<br />
If you don't use banning at all, you can safely ignore this setting completely.</p>

<a name="admin_general_browsable_batch_add"><h4>Browsable batch-add interface</h4></a>
<p>When <a href="uploading.htm#batch_add_pics">batch-adding</a> files (that you have uploaded using a <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> before) to your gallery, you have the option to switch between a browsable list, where you can go scroll through the directory structure in your <tt class="code">albums</tt>-folder or to display the whole directory structure at once. Enable this option if you have a larger structure of directories and subdirectories you want to browse through (this requires your browser to be capable of displaying <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp" class="external" rel="external">iframes</a>). Set this option to &quot;No&quot; (disabled) if you want to use the &quot;classic&quot; coppermine interface that shows a complete list of the structure at once.<br />
Should you have difficulties using one, try the other. You can toggle between these options on the <a href="uploading.htm#batch_add_pics">batch-add</a> page as well.</p>

<a name="admin_language"><h3>Language &amp; Charset settings</h3></a>
<p><img src="pics/config_language.gif" width="612" height="234" border="1" alt="" /></p>
<a name="admin_language_language"><h4>Language</h4></a>
<p>This sets the default language for your gallery. All language files are stored in the <strong>lang</strong> directory on your server.</p>
<p>Languages and internationalization (often refered to as i18n) is a complicated and complex thing. You (as Coppermine admin) probably don't want to go into details, so this documentation skips the in-depth issues existing with i18n and just gives you an overview how Coppermine handles languages:</p>
<p>By default, language files are unicode encoded files. If you set "Character encoding" to "Unicode (utf-8)" then the script will auto detect the preferred language of your visitors based on what default language is configured in their browsers. If the corresponding language is available in your language directory, it will be used. Otherwise, the default language file will be used.</p>
<p>When the script auto detects the preferred language, it stores the result in a cookie on the visitor's computer. To reset this cookie (and thus force the script to do another auto detection) the user must call this autodetect function with something like: <a href="#">http://yoursite.com/coppermine_dir/index.php?lang=xxx</a></p>
<p>These steps are performed by the script:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Step one: Check "has a specific language been set by cookie or URL parameter?". If yes, the gallery will be displayed in that language, all subsequent steps are being skipped</li>
  <li>Step two: which language has the user set as default language in his browser? If that language exists as Coppermine language file, it will be used - the subsequent step will be skipped.</li>
  <li>Last step: only if the previous steps both don't apply, the default language that the admin has set up on the config page will be taken into account</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have added comments or files to your gallery, you should not change the character set of your gallery. If you do so, non-ASCII characters may not display properly.</p>

<a name="admin_language_language_end"></a>
<hr />
<a name="admin_language_fallback"><h4>Fallback to English if translated phrase not found?</h4></a>
<p>Enable this option if you're using language files that haven't been created for the Coppermine version you use, but for an earlier version. If a certain word or phrase doesn't exist within your language file, coppermine will display the equivalent english phrase, instead.</p>
<p>This feature has been introduced to allow the use of previous version language files -- language files that may have not been translated for the this version, yet. Until an updated version of the language file is made available, you can use this option. Most translation differences affect the admin part of coppermine only, so  the admin will experience most of these untranslated strings. The admin will see some phrases in english instead of his/her preferred language for strings and words that don't exist in the currently available language file. NOTE: this fallback option only works for 95% of all phrases, there may still be some other translation omissions.</p>
<p class="important">Enabling this option can have a huge impact on the overall performance of your gallery, especially the memory usage (RAM) may increase drastically. It is recommended to only enable this option if you must have it, not just out of curiosity or to enable as many features as possible.</p>

Subsequently, if a user right-clicks the image and uses the "save as..." context menu of his browser, only the transparent gif will be saved on his PC, but not the actual image he tried to save. This option will reduce the number of users who are capable to steal your images, but it will only fool newbie users. There is no effective method to completely avoid image theft, but the transparent overlay method is much better than any no-right-click script that keeps users from the legitimate use of the right mouse button and subsequently makes them shy away. Please note that the transparent overlay is being added by using the deprecated HTML attribute "background" to avoid the context menu entry "save background image" that would appear if the overlay image was added using standards-compliant CSS methods. Subsequently, your pages will not contain valid, standards-compliant HTML output if this option is enabled, so you should turn off the  option &quot;<a href="#vanity_block">Display the vanity block on themes that are defined as XHTML and CSS compliant</a>&quot;.<br />Recommended (and default) setting for this option is "off".</p>

Therefore, it is recommended that you set this value to a size that is slightly lower or equal to the max file size that your server is set to handle. The actual size your server can handle cannot be determined by Coppermine (or any PHP script) - when in doubt, contact your webhost.</p> <p>Prior to an FTP upload of files, it is recommended that the admin use their imaging software to resize (individually or by batch processing) larger files to a more practical size.

Contact your webhost/server if you are not sure about your site's file size limitations. (Ideally, users will resize their pictures to a more manageable size prior to attempting any uploads. Determine what you would like the maximum size for a full size pic should be (dpi and dimensions, while keeping in mind the screen size of your users) and use that as a recommended standard for FTP and user HTTP uploads.

<p>A significant number of webhosts on the Internet run PHP in <a href="http://www.php.net/phpinfo" rel="external" class="external">safe mode</a>. Coppermine runs without any problem in safe mode and with the "open basedir restriction" active, provided safe mode is properly configured. Unfortunately, on many hosts, safe mode is not configured properly.<br />
If you have issues uploading pics, find out if safe_mode is enabled on your webserver by searching for it on your phpinfo page (go to admin tools -&gt; phpinfo). If safe_mode is enabled there, coppermine might be able to workaround the misconfiguration of your server if you enable coppermine's "silly safe mode" option.</p>
<p>What "silly safe mode" does: if you enable this option, Coppermine will not try to create sub-folders for each user, but upload all files into the root of the userpics folder. There might be a slight performance impact for larger galleries, but then you probably won't be running a large gallery on a "crippled" webserver that is not configured properly.</p>
<p>Before playing with the silly safe mode option, make sure that you have <a href="install_permissions.htm#permissions">set permissions</a> on the albums folder and everything within it as suggested.</p>

<p>Usually nothing has to be changed here; leave all fields blank when not sure. Only if you run into problems (e.g. if ecards, registration info or notifications don't get sent) you should change these settings. Coppermine itself doesn't come with an engine to send mails, it relies on a webserver being able to do so (using the built-in mechanisms of PHP). If you're not sure what to enter, ask your webhost for support.</p>


<p><span class="important">Using SMTP to send emails</span>: by default the script uses the PHP built-in <strong>mail</strong> function to send emails. In some cases, the PHP built-in function can't be used.</p>
<p> If, in order to send emails with PHP, you are required to supply a <strong>hostname</strong>, a <strong>username</strong> and a <strong>password</strong>, you will need to edit the CONFIG menu section &quot;Email settings&quot; and insert the correct values there. If you don't need a username and password to connect to your SMTP server, just leave these lines blank. If you don't know what settings to enter, you will need to check with your webhost.</p>


<h4>SMTP Host</h4>
<p>The hostname of the <acronym title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</acronym> server<br />
If you leave this blank, sendmail (or a surrogate) will be used to send emails from your server. Sendmail exists on most Unix/Linux webservers. If you specify a SMTP hostname, Coppermine will try to send emails using SMTP (this usually is needed on Windows webservers).</p>
