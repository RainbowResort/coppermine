<p>As most other applications that have some sort of <a href="users.htm#user_cp">user management</a>, Coppermine comes with tasks that can only be performed by an administrator. It is advisable not to name the admin account just &quot;admin&quot; or &quot;administrator&quot;, but to use your real name or nick name that you would like to see appear next to your uploads and comments.<br />
It is mandatory that you memorize your admin account data and/or keep it at some safe place; although you might have set up your browser to memorize the password, you may need it at some later stage.<br />
Wether an account has admin powers or not is being determined by group membership: members of the built-in group &quot;administrators&quot; have admin powers. You can manage your groups on the &quot;<a href="groups.htm#group_cp">groups control panel</a>&quot;.<br />
Technically, it is possible to have more than one gallery administrator, but it is recommended to carefully consider giving admin powers to others: only grant admin powers to users you <strong>fully</strong> trust.</p>
<p>When logged in as admin, you will see an <a href="admin_menu.htm">admin menu</a> that displays all additional options and menu entries that you (as admin) have compared to regular (non-admin) users or guests.</p>
<p>Basic as well as advanced settings that have an impact on your entire gallery are being determined on the config screen - some of them are mandatory to set up properly when running Coppermine in the first place, so it's advisable to carefully look into the <a href="configuration.htm#admin">configuration</a> section.</p>
<p>In Coppermine, <a href="files.htm">files</a> are being organized within a category/album structure. To set categories and albums up and maintain them, use the <a href="categories.htm#cat_cp">categories control panel</a> and the <a href="albums.htm#albmgr">Album Manager</a>.</p>
<p>Bulletin Board Code (also known as &quot;<a href="bbcode.htm">BBCODE</a>&quot;) can be used to add links, email addresses and some basic formats to text fields like description fields.</p>
<p>Your Coppermine gallery is capable to extract picture meta data and store them in the database. You can manage the meta data in EXIF format using the <a href="exif.htm#exif_manager">EXIF manager</a>.</p>
<p>Additional functionaltity that is not needed for all galleries but helpfull for many can be added using <a href="plugins.htm">plugins</a>.</p>
