Fixed bug found by Aditya: The bottom and left selectors on red box in resize editor doesn't work. Remove them if they are no of any use or add functionality for it.
Fixed bug found by Aditya: Just noticed that ctime attribute in pictures tag in gallery.xml has negative value. I guess you should cast it to long int instead of normal integer. Also filesize should be casted to long int as this value can also go out of range.
Improved the user of the gridbag layout in the picturelist where before there where some refreshing problems showing a lot of parts of pictures
