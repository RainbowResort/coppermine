  <p align="left"><strong>About<br />
  </strong>Coppermine Photo Gallery is one of the most popular and most used photo galleries in the world. Whenever you are online, you can access your Coppermine site to upload your pictures and share them with the rest of the world.<br />
  The problem is that when you are not online, accessing your Coppermine will not be possible. JCpg solves this problem. You can use this program to offline add categories, albums and pictures. Whenever you come across an Internet connection, all you have to do is hit the sync button and all information will be send to your Coppermine site.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>The layout<br />
  </strong>We wanted to make JCpg's layout as simple as possible. When you first started JCpg, you might have noticed that there aren't a lot of windows and buttons. At the left hand side, you see a tree which represents the  state of your site's structure as it was when you last synced all information. The root can contain categories and albums. Each category can also contain categories and albums. Albums can contain pictures. In the root, by default there is a category named 'User Galleries'. All elements in this category will appear on the home page of your Coppermine site.<br />
      <br />
    On the right hand side, different things can be shown. If you select a category in the tree, you will enter something we call 'Album view'. <br />
