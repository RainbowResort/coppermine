Coppermine Gallery 1.3.3 and vBulletin 3.0.0 Integration
Version 1.0
Compiled by SpeedStreet

I'm not the hacker for this; I am merely the guy who poured through all of the threads on vBulletin.org and the Coppermine Development Forums to come up with one definitive post about integrating vBulletin with Coppermine.

WHAT IT DOES:
At the end of this how-to, you're installations of vBulletin and Coppermine will work together off of the same login.  While everyone else wants to see all sorts of integration between the two, I believe this is the first step to making those things happen.

CREDITS:
A big thanks to everyone over at Coppermine for a terrific product and the users that support and mod it on a daily basis.  I am merely standing on the shoulders of giants here, folks.   Also, Nanobot was the guy over there that did the vB3 Gamma bridge, so the credit for that is all his.

FILES TO EDIT (2):
/bridge/vbulletin30.inc.php  (Coppermine)
/include/init.inc.php  (Coppermine)

HACK REQUIREMENTS:
vBulletin 3.0.0 Installed and Running
Coppermine 1.2.1 Installed and Running
5 Minutes of your time

FINAL WARNINGS:

There are seem to be some issues with people integrating this with forums located on subdomains (e.g. subaruforums.speedstreet.org).  Please reference the Coppermine Gamma Thread above for more info.
Please ensure that Coppermine and vBulletin cookies are NOT named the same thing.

-------------------------------------

HOW TO INTEGRATE:
1.) Download vbulletin30.inc.php (provided as an archive with this hack)
2.) Open for Editing vbulletin30.inc.php and edit the following with data specific to your site:

//NOTE : Your vBulletin license number is provided at the top of every php file in your vBulletin installation!
define('VB_CUST_NO', 'xxxxxxxx'); // Your vBulletin license number (NOT your customer number)
define('VB_DB_NAME', 'forum'); // The name of the database used by the board
define('VB_BD_HOST', 'localhost'); // The name of the database server
define('VB_DB_USERNAME', 'username'); // The username to use to connect to the database
define('VB_DB_PASSWORD', 'password'); // The password to use to connect to the database

// The web path to your vBulletin Board directory
// In this example http://yoursite_name.com/vbulletin3/
define('VB_WEB_PATH', '/vbulletin3/');

3.) Save vbulletin30.inc.php to the bridge directory of your Coppermine installation
4.) Open for Editing init.inc.php (located in the /include directory of your Coppermine installation
Find:
// define('UDB_INTEGRATION', 'vbulletin30');
Remove the double slashes in front of the line to uncomment

5. Save init.inc.php to the include directory of your Coppermine installation
6. Point your browser to your Coppermine installation and verify integration is complete.

That should do it.  I tried it on a fresh install of both, and a custom install to an existing board.  Both worked fine.
