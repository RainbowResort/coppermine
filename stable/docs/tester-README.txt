Dear Tester,

Thank you for taking the time to test Coppermine Photo Gallery.
Please be rough on the program so that we can track down and
eliminate bugs from our public release of version 1.3.

While testing CPG 1.3, please make certain to note any odd behavior you
encounter.  This could include typographical errors, misleading instructions,
or any other out-right error.  If you encounter a major error, please switch
the debug mode to "on" in the configuration panel and copy the text in the
debug window.  This will greatly aid the development team in hunting down the
problem.

Areas to be particularly mindful of:

. Please test every facet of CPG, from the installation on to every feature
  available (and in as many themes as possible).
. If you have the ability to test GD, GD2 and ImageMagick, please test all of them.
. Please attempt to use multiple types of graphics such as JPEG, PNG and GIF (for
  IM users).

Please report your test results to the testing board at http://coppermine.sourceforge.net/board/viewforum.php?f=19 .

The report format should include:

Server OS
Web Server Software
GD, GD2 or ImageMagick Test
PHP Version
BB Integration (if any)
Themes fully tested (by fully tested, we mean as many different features as
possible using that theme)
Major Errors
Client OS and Browser
Fresh install or upgrade (if yes, from which version of cpg)

Your test results will not merely be used to fix problems but will also be used
to tout the compatibility of CPG with multiple browsers and OS's.  That is why
this information is important EVEN IF YOU FIND NOTHING WRONG.

Thanks for your participation and your time in making CPG the premiere
open-source photo gallery!

Coppermine Development Team
